# Welcome to One of the Tiniest Global Villages on the Internet 🔬, built by byte-sized ideas💡!

My name is 👨🏻‍💻Gio and I'm the founder of Tiny Global Village. I'm currently building my portfolio to become an asset to the Open Source World 🌐. 

While I've dabbled with html and css for over 20 years, it's only been in the last 5 years that I really started to take to my coding passions in earnest 🤾🏻‍♂️. 

Over the last 2 years, I've embarked in a lot of training, including studying at App Academy for 7 months. There I studied extensively in Javascript before life circumstances prevented me from completing my journey with them. 

Right now, I'm pursuing my second Bachelor's in Computer Science with the aim to gain a Master's in the Science of Information Technology. We are currently learning Python.

Independently, I'm working to complete my first fullstack project that I started at App Acaddemy using Express, React, and Sequelize by cloning MeetUp.
